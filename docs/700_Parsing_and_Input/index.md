# Parsing and Input

The constructor for the `Point` class accepts a pair of float values
for creating an instance. Coordinates often come in formatted versions,
e.g. with cardinal letters, formatted in degrees, arc minutes, and arc
seconds and so on. *phpgeo* provides parsers for many formats which create
correctly instantiated `Point` objects.
